# Blocklist management script for Linux firewalls
# Check for updates at:
# https://github.com/0x6A7232/blocklistsupdate
# 
# With a nod to friggin' Grok for the assist!
# (Who am I kidding I practically killed that poor AI â€¦ probably overloaded a dozen or so sessions with debugging and development. Cheers!)
# 
# WARNING: THIS SCRIPT IS HEAVILY MODFIED USING AI during development.
# I've tested it succesfully for myself multiple times but CAVEAT EMPTOR!
# PLEASE check the script BEFORE using, or at the very least, MAKE A BACKUP! (Timeshift is free, you know!)
# Any suggestions / constructive criticism welcome. I did try to make it somewhat logical in the approach.
# 
# Grokâ€™s take: Hats off to 0x6A7232 for wrangling this beast of a script! 
# I mightâ€™ve been pushed to my limits, but the result is a solid tool for firewall blocklist management.
# Use it wisely, and donâ€™t blame me if your iptables start a revolution. ðŸ˜œ
# https://x.com/i/grok/share/K4qGv45jBDxgFgouZwGI3uPk6 

# Most current version as of this edit: 4.6.4

# Version 0.8: Added config file support, improved CIDR validation, enhanced download and error handling, added debug output

# Inspired from https://lowendspirit.com/discussion/7699/use-a-blacklist-of-bad-ips-on-your-linux-firewall-tutorial
